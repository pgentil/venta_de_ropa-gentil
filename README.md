# Final proyect for Web Development Certificate for Coderhouse
## Author: Pedro Gentil
The main idea of this proyect was to design a site to sell clothes for a fashion brand in Argentina. The website is completely static, and as a user you can only surf through the next pages: Home, Articles, Contact and History. SEO is included in all pages, and style is generated using SASS as preprocessor. Additionally, this website uses boostrap as a framework to make use of some of the structures it provides.
